# Stable-Marriage-Algorithm

This is just a fun side project I made based off of the following youtube videos. As the video explains, it tries to match all people to their most stable marriage partner. Stable is defined such that for each person in the marraige, there is no other person that they would prefer to be married to whom also would prefer to be married with them. For example, Bob and Mary are married, but Bob would rather be married to Janet. If Janet would also prefer to be married to Bob over her current husband, both marriages are unsatable. BUT if Bob prefers Janet, but Janet does not prefer Bob, BOTH marriages are still stable.
